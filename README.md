# Electron Vue Vuetify Boilerplate

A customized fork of [electron-boilerplate](https://github.com/szwacz/electron-boilerplate)

Credit for the foundation of this boilerplate goes completely to szwacz. It is a great start for electron projects
in general! It even has a great initial testing setup (consider testing if you are not, you will love it... ok BUT
you will find the results are worth the effort). 

I added [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) for a ready to go vue based electron 
app build.

```
git clone {the repo}

cd electron-vue-vuetify-boilerplate

yarn

yarn start

... make it your own ... 
```  

Useful ? Ether tips appreciated 0x387006D751F266a2FB8De03B589Cf7a6e7c844A3
