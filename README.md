# Chrome Extension Webpack Boilerplate - Vue.js

A customized fork of [electron-boilerplate](https://github.com/szwacz/electron-boilerplate)

Credit for the foundation of this boilerplate goes completely to szwacz. It is a great start for electron projects
in general! It even has a great initial testing setup (consider testing if you are not, you will love it). 

I added [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) for a ready to go vue based electron app build  

Useful ? Ether tips appreciated 0x387006D751F266a2FB8De03B589Cf7a6e7c844A3
